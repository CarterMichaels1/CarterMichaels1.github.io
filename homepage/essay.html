              LeFrak Ice Skating Center
          </h1>

          <p>
              Lefrak was just an ice skating rink in the park to me. I went there with my grandparents for birthdays and Christmas sometimes. And while those times were special, I never really appreciated how beautiful the rink really was. In 2015, I started ice skating after school on Wednesdays with my friends. When we got to the rink, we would put on the chipped rental skates with blueish gray laces torn to pieces. We would skate around the freshly cleaned ice, slipping and sliding in our oversized snow pants and puffy winter coats. We believed we were indestructible in all that clothing. As the ice skating lessons ended, we grew out of the snowpants, got our own new skates, and took a different walk in the park. Even though LeFrak is just an ice skating rink in the park, it has made me grow so much as a person and made me a real New Yorker.

Whenever I ice skate, nothing matters. I'm always at peace. Whether I am ten first learning how to skate, thirteen playing hockey, sixteen going on a date, or making new memories in the years to come, LeFrak has been and will always be the same. I skate knowing that I will be back to skate again next year. Maybe skating means something different to me than it does to you, but the feel of the minty wind on your face and the smooth ice scraping under your skates is what makes each incredible experience the same. That feeling you get when you step on the ice for the first time each season and the final goodbye in the spring is the same every year. It's a way for me to see myself as a different person while going through the same motions. LeFrak can be a self check-in for everyone. It makes sure you are doing okay. It fades out all of your thoughts and feelings, dumbing down life into just gliding along the ice next to the most important people in your life. And while you never want this feeling of peace to end in the spring it will. Forcing you to wait another 7 months before your next LeFrak check-in.

I am not the best at ice skating, but every year I just try to get a little better, a little faster, a little tighter on the crossovers. Not only is it fun, it's an opportunity for me to devote my time and energy into something I genuinely love. Ice skating at LeFrak has changed the way I have seen the world over the last six years, forcing me to interact with people I certainly would never have met outside of skating and making me more comfortable with failure. The comfortability with failure is something that ice skating teaches you really quickly and really well. If you are scared to fall down, you will never even get off the wall. But if you really put yourself out there and try your hardest, you might fall down, but you will get better at skating and become more comfortable.

LeFrak, while just a part of the park, is a blend of people from all over the city. You have people from the neighborhoods close by and travelers from other boroughs, and nobody sees LeFrak quite the same. It can be used as a way to bond with friends, meet new people, or as a way to get out of the house. But what's important is that no matter who you are, where you come from, or why you are there, everyone is skating. What makes this place special isn't that it isn't particularly nice or welcoming or even kind. But past the falling down, past the vast diversity of this city, and past individuality, we are just a group of people. And we are all wearing ice skates. All skating in a circle. Together. This shows what living in New York City is really like. Beside whatever may separate us, we all share one thing. We are New Yorkers.
